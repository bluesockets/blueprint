Blueprint .01

If you've ever had to set up a web application from scratch, you know it's a road that can have many pitfalls. Blueprint strives to help make this process easier by gluing together the stack for you and providing a standard codebase with basic functionality. It ships with a basic user authentication module to start, and can be altered, updated to fit your needs.
